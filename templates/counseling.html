    <span class="tehword">Life</span> is full of interpersonal and emotional challenges.
    Sometimes these periods of uncertainty and challenge can be frightening. However,
    I believe they provide an opportunity to grow, attain inner peace and
    create a new beginning. My goal is to provide a safe and confidential
    space in which you can explore your personal concerns in order to develop
    and attain personal goals, achieve authentic relationships and gain self awareness.

              I enjoy working with parents to create a healthy environment in which their
              children can thrive. I typically meet with the parents first to hear all about
              their childâ€™s strengths and struggles. Then, as I meet with your child I measure
              their self-concept, anxiety, depression, anger, resiliency, and reactivity as I
              hear from them what is working in their life and what is not.

        I enjoy the challenge of adolescent counseling &amp; helping teens navigate
        the tricky waters of middle school and high school. Being an adolescent
        is not easy; managing schoolwork, peer pressure, sports, relationships,
        electronics, driving, and college applications can be overwhelming. Conflict
        around these issues can put teens and their parents at risk for depression and anxiety.
        <br /><br />
        I work to help teens appreciate their parents and help parents celebrate the launching
        of their teens. I teach adolescents social and life skills that will serve them
        throughout their life in schools, families, and in the job market.

        The adults that I work with are successful, smart, and determined to work
        on the one or two areas that are not working in their lives. I partner with
        them in building more satisfying personal lives, relationships, and careers.
        I see people who have tried everything and have made the courageous decision
        to admit they need some help.
        <br /><br />
        Nothing is more frustrating than trying really hard and still feeling
        like the particular problem is not getting better. I help my clients learn
        new approaches, so they don't simply try hard, but actually see progress.
        Most clients report they wish they had started the process sooner!
