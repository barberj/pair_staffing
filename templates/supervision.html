    <span class="tehword">Counselor Supervision</span> is a service provided to
      counseling program graduates and/or professional school counselors who
      are pursuing licensure as a Professional Counselor in the state of Georgia.
      Supervision is an interactive process intended to monitor the quality of client
      care, improve clinical skills, and facilitate professional growth. My personal
      approach to supervision is one of providing an environment of growth for a
      professional, to honestly evaluate his/her work performance, counseling
      skills and personal issues they bring into their practice. Supervision
      will be a mixture of case review, collaborative problem solving, chart
      review and support.  As your supervisor, I will serve as teacher, consultant,
      and evaluator.  We will work on accountability to ethics and best
      practice principles through reflecting together on your work.
